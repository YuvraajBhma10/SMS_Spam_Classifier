# SMS_Spam_Classifier
In this project, I've used Natural Language Processing on SMS data to predict if a SMS will be Spam or Not Spam. I've tried different Machine Learning methods like multinomial-naive-bayes, logistic regression, SVM, and decision trees to see which one works best. To make sure the data was clean and ready for analysis, I used tools like PorterStemmer, CountVectorizer, TFIDF Vectorizer, and WordnetLemmatizer. I used Python's Streamlit library to convert my code into web application.
